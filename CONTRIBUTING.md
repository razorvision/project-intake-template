## Code of Conduct

This project follows our [Code of Conduct](docs/guides/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you agree to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to the project maintainers.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before contributing, ensure you have:

- **Git** - Version control
- **GitHub account** - For pull requests
- **Node.js 18+** - For running validation scripts
- **GitHub CLI** (optional but recommended) - For automation
- **Code editor** - VS Code, Vim, etc.

### Initial Setup

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/RV_2.0.git
   cd RV_2.0
   ```
3. **Add upstream remote**:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/razorvision/RV_2.0.git
   ```
4. **Install dependencies** (if any):
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## How to Contribute

### Types of Contributions

We welcome various types of contributions:

- 🐛 **Bug fixes** - Fix issues in documentation, scripts, or templates
- ✨ **New features** - Add new MCP servers, slash commands, or workflow enhancements
- 📚 **Documentation** - Improve guides, add examples, fix typos
- 🧪 **Examples** - Add sample projects or use cases
- 💡 **Ideas** - Suggest improvements via issues

### Finding Something to Work On

- Browse [open issues](https://github.com/razorvision/RV_2.0/issues)
- Look for issues labeled `good first issue` or `help wanted`
- Check the [project board](https://github.com/razorvision/RV_2.0/projects) for planned work
- Propose new ideas by opening an issue first

## Development Workflow

### 1. Create a Branch

Always create a feature branch from `main`:

```bash
git checkout main
git pull upstream main
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

**Branch naming conventions:**
- `feature/` - New features or enhancements
- `bugfix/` - Bug fixes
- `docs/` - Documentation changes
- `refactor/` - Code refactoring
- `test/` - Test additions or modifications

See [BRANCH_STRATEGY.md](docs/guides/BRANCH_STRATEGY.md) for complete guidelines.

### 2. Make Your Changes

- Follow the [Coding Standards](docs/guides/CODING_STANDARDS.md)
- Keep changes focused and atomic
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages
- Test your changes thoroughly

### 3. Commit Your Changes

Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format:

```bash
git commit -m "feat: add new MCP server configuration"
git commit -m "fix: correct broken link in README"
git commit -m "docs: improve quick start instructions"
```

**Commit types:**
- `feat:` - New feature
- `fix:` - Bug fix
- `docs:` - Documentation changes
- `style:` - Formatting, no code change
- `refactor:` - Code restructuring
- `test:` - Adding tests
- `chore:` - Maintenance tasks

### 4. Keep Your Branch Updated

Regularly sync with upstream:

```bash
git fetch upstream
git rebase upstream/main
```

### 5. Push Your Changes

```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

## Pull Request Process

### Before Submitting

- [ ] Changes are focused on a single concern
- [ ] Code follows project coding standards
- [ ] Documentation is updated (if applicable)
- [ ] All validation scripts pass: `npm run health-check`
- [ ] Commit messages follow conventional format
- [ ] Branch is up to date with `main`

### Submitting a Pull Request

1. **Push your branch** to your fork
2. **Open a pull request** on GitHub
3. **Fill out the PR template** completely
4. **Link related issues** using keywords (e.g., "Fixes #123")
5. **Request review** from maintainers

### PR Title Format

Use the same format as commit messages:

```
feat: add PostgreSQL MCP server documentation
fix: correct setup script for Windows
docs: improve MCP security guidelines
```

### Review Process

- Maintainers will review your PR within 1-3 business days
- Address any requested changes promptly
- Keep the conversation focused and respectful
- Once approved, a maintainer will merge your PR

### After Merging

- Delete your feature branch (locally and on GitHub)
- Update your local main branch:
  ```bash
  git checkout main
  git pull upstream main
  ```
