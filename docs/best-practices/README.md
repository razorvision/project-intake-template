**Read:** [Error Handling Guide](ERROR_HANDLING.md)

---

### 6. State Management

**Topics Covered:**
- Local vs. global state
- State synchronization
- Persistence strategies
- React patterns
- State machines

**Key Principles:**
- ✅ Keep state close to where it's used
- ✅ Minimize global state
- ✅ Use appropriate tools (Context, Redux, Zustand)
- ❌ Prop drilling excessively
- ❌ Over-engineering state

**Read:** [State Management Guide](STATE_MANAGEMENT.md)

---

### 7. API Design

**Topics Covered:**
- RESTful conventions
- Versioning strategies
- Error responses
- Documentation
- Rate limiting

**Key Principles:**
- ✅ Follow REST conventions
- ✅ Version your API
- ✅ Provide clear error messages
- ❌ Inconsistent naming
- ❌ Breaking changes without versioning

**Read:** [API Design Patterns](API_DESIGN_PATTERNS.md)

---

### 8. Decision Trees

**Visual guides for common decisions:**
- Which database should I use?
- Which state management solution?
- Which deployment platform?
- Which testing strategy?
- Which caching approach?

**Read:** [Decision Trees](DECISION_TREES.md)

## 🎓 How to Use These Guides

### 1. Before Starting a Feature

Review relevant best practices:
```
"I'm adding user authentication"
→ Read: Security Hardening, Error Handling, Database Design
```

### 2. During Code Review

Reference specific patterns:
```
"Should we use local or global state here?"
→ Check: State Management Guide
```

### 3. When Refactoring

Identify anti-patterns:
```
"This code feels messy"
→ Review: Code Organization
```

### 4. When Debugging

Understand root causes:
```
"Why is this slow?"
→ Check: Performance Guide
```

## 🏆 The Golden Rules

### 1. **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)**
- Simple solutions are easier to maintain
- Don't over-engineer for future requirements
- Refactor when complexity is justified

### 2. **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**
- Extract reusable logic
- But don't abstract prematurely
- Three strikes and refactor

### 3. **YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)**
- Build what you need now
- Don't add features "just in case"
- Future requirements often change

### 4. **Separation of Concerns**
- Each module has one responsibility
- Clear boundaries between layers
- Easy to test in isolation

### 5. **Fail Fast**
- Validate early and often
- Surface errors immediately
- Make bugs obvious

### 6. **Security by Default**
- Secure patterns from day one
- Validate all inputs
- Principle of least privilege

### 7. **Measure First**
- Profile before optimizing
- Metrics over opinions
- Data-driven decisions

- ❌ Loading all data upfront

### Security
- ❌ SQL injection vulnerabilities
- ❌ Storing passwords in plaintext
- ❌ Missing rate limiting

### Error Handling
- ❌ Empty catch blocks
- ❌ Exposing stack traces to users
- ❌ Not logging errors

### State Management
- ❌ Excessive prop drilling
- ❌ Everything in global state
- ❌ Not cleaning up state

### API Design
- ❌ Inconsistent naming
- ❌ Using GET for mutations
- ❌ No versioning strategy

## 📊 Decision Framework

When faced with a decision, ask:

1. **What's the simplest solution?**
   - Start here, complexity later if needed

2. **What are the trade-offs?**
   - Every decision has pros and cons
   - Document your reasoning

3. **Is this premature optimization?**
   - Optimize when you have data
   - Not based on assumptions

4. **Can I defer this decision?**
   - Make reversible decisions quickly
   - Delay irreversible ones until necessary

5. **What would future me thank me for?**
   - Good documentation
   - Simple, testable code
   - Clear architecture
